# Delete a web application

[![appservice/delete-webapp/README.md](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-on-azure-examples/actions/workflows/appservice_delete-webapp_README_md.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-on-azure-examples/actions/workflows/appservice_delete-webapp_README_md.yml)

## Prerequisites

This example assumes you have previously completed the following examples:

1. [Create an Azure Resource Group](../../group/create/README.md)
1. [Deploy a web application on a managed Tomcat](../tomcat-helloworld/README.md)

## Delete a web application

<!-- workflow.run()

  if [[ -z $REGION ]]; then
    export REGION=westus
  fi

  -->
<!-- workflow.cron(0 6 * * 4) -->
<!-- workflow.include(../tomcat-helloworld/README.md) -->

To delete the web application from Azure App Service use the following command line:

```shell
  az webapp delete --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $APPSERVICE_TOMCAT_HELLOWORLD
```

If you want to make sure the web application has been removed, you can execute 
the following command. It should tell you the resource could not be found.

```text
  az webapp show --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $APPSERVICE_TOMCAT_HELLOWORLD
```

Note you can substitute `$APPSERVICE_TOMCAT_HELLOWORLD` with the name of any web
application you want to delete in your resource group.

<!-- workflow.directOnly() 

  export RESULT=$(az webapp show --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $APPSERVICE_TOMCAT_HELLOWORLD --output tsv --query state)
  az group delete --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --yes || true
  if [[ "$RESULT" == Running ]]; then
    exit 1
  fi

  -->

## Cleanup

Do NOT forget to remove the resources once you are done running the example.
