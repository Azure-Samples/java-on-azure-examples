[![appservice/delete-plan/README.md](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-on-azure-examples/actions/workflows/appservice_delete-plan_README_md.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-on-azure-examples/actions/workflows/appservice_delete-plan_README_md.yml)

## Prerequisites

This example assumes you have previously completed the following examples:

1. [Create an Azure Resource Group](../../group/create/README.md)
1. [Create an Azure App Service Plan](../create-plan/README.md)

## Delete an App Service Plan

<!-- workflow.run()

  if [[ -z $REGION ]]; then
    export REGION=westus
  fi

  -->
<!-- workflow.cron(0 5 * * 3) -->
<!-- workflow.include(../create-plan/README.md) -->

To delete the Azure App Service Plan use the following command line:

```shell
  az appservice plan delete \
    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --name $APPSERVICE_PLAN \
    --yes
```

<!-- workflow.directOnly() 

  export RESULT=$(az appservice plan show --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $APPSERVICE_PLAN --query provisioningState --output tsv)
  az group delete --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --yes || true
  if [[ "$RESULT" == Succeeded ]]; then
    exit 1
  fi

  -->

## Cleanup

Do NOT forget to remove the resources once you are done running the example.
